# Toolgle Information Retrieval Toolkit

The program, Toolgle, is a system designed to facilitate out-of-the-box text retrieval. It is integrated with the [BEIR (Benchmarking Information Retrieval)](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir) framework for testing and provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). This combination allows users to efficiently retrieve and test text data while interacting with a user-friendly interface.

## Usage

To use Toolgle, you can run Docker Compose and access the application on port 3000:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
